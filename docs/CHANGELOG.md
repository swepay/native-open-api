# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.6] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Source Generator**: Fixed endpoint detection fallback when `IMethodSymbol` cannot be resolved from semantic model.
  Added `CandidateSymbols` fallback and syntax-based extraction for cases where NuGet package methods
  are not fully resolved during incremental generation.
- **Source Generator**: Removed `IncludeBuildOutput=false` from csproj to fix `ProjectReference` with
  `OutputItemType="Analyzer"` not loading the generator DLL.

### Added
- **Sample Project**: Complete working sample `SampleApiFunction` demonstrating:
  - `RoutedApiGatewayFunction` (NativeLambdaRouter 2.0.2) with 6 REST endpoints
  - `IRequestHandler<TCommand, TResponse>` handlers (NativeMediator 1.0.4)
  - `JsonSerializerContext` for Native AOT serialization
  - Source Generator producing OpenAPI 3.1 spec at compile-time

### Removed
- Deleted `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (issues resolved)
- Deleted `TempInspect` temporary inspection project
- Deleted stale `Models.cs` from sample (caused duplicate type definitions without `IRequest<T>`)

## [1.2.5] - 2025-07-15

### Fixed
- **Source Generator**: Enhanced endpoint detection to support NativeLambdaRouter 2.x API.
  Now checks receiver type interfaces and extension method patterns.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- **NativeLambdaRouter.SourceGenerator.OpenApi**: Roslyn Source Generator that discovers
  `MapGet<TCommand, TResponse>`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, `MapDelete`, `MapPatch` invocations
  on `IRouteBuilder` and generates OpenAPI 3.1 YAML specifications at compile-time.
